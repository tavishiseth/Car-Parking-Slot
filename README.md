## Project Overview:
Nowadays while traveling to a new place or traveling for shopping or traveling to crowded laces the main problem people face is where to park their four-wheeler safely.  
So, assume there is a company Car Parking Solutions which came up with an idea to solve this problem by booking the parking slots beforehand while traveling to the concerned place.  
They also have workers who provide additional benefits to users who park their four-wheelers in their parking slots by dry cleaning, car-washing and also do check for any repairs in the concerned parking time.  
They need you to create a beautiful online car parking slot booking web application.  
This application should enable the users to book the parking slot beforehand while traveling to any shopping malls, tourist spots, markets, pilgrim centers especially crowded places.  
The following functionalities should be supported by the application.
